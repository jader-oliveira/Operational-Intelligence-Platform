# Evidence Engine

## Purpose

Provide the evidence engine capability as an independently deployable, observable, and policy-controlled service.

## Responsibilities

- Build bounded evidence-acquisition plans from incident scope and hypotheses.
- Query metrics, logs, events, changes, configuration, graph, tickets, and runbooks.
- Maintain time windows, provenance, quality, relevance, and contradictions.
- Create immutable evidence bundles.

## Inputs

- Canonical asset, incident, evidence, policy, and organization context.
- Authenticated requests through the API gateway or durable workflow engine.
- Versioned configuration and schemas.

## Outputs

- Structured, schema-validated records.
- Provenance and audit metadata.
- Service metrics, logs, and traces.
- Domain events for downstream consumers.

## Constraints and safety

- Evidence is permission-filtered.
- Collection budget limits query volume and model context.
- Missing evidence is explicit.

## Scaling and failure behavior

- Horizontally scalable workers where applicable.
- Backpressure and bounded concurrency.
- Retry only idempotent operations.
- Dead-letter or quarantine invalid work.
- Degrade per source or capability rather than failing the whole platform.

## Required telemetry

- Request and workflow latency.
- Success, error, timeout, and retry rates.
- Queue depth and saturation.
- Data freshness and evidence coverage.
- AI tokens, GPU time, cost, and structured-output validation failures where applicable.

## Test strategy

- Unit tests for domain logic.
- Schema and contract tests.
- Integration tests with simulated and lab systems.
- Failure-injection tests.
- Security and authorization tests.
- Scale tests against the 2,000-VM target profile.
